=> Phone Book
=============================================

Plan to build the Phone Book Application with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- The app will alllow users to add, edit, and delete contacts from a table after validating the form inputs.

1. HTML Structure
Creating the HTML Structure: 
- Creating the contact form (form to input contact details).
- Creating the table to display the contacts.
- Input fields: First Name, Last Name and Phone Number.
- Buttons for Save, Edit and Delete operations.

2. CSS Style
Style the page with CSS (style the form, the table and the buttons to make the interface better and more user-friendly.)

3. JavaScript
In the JavaScript implementation of the Phone Book Api, I will use variables, functions and events 
to manage the contacts and the interactions within the app.
- Creating variables: 1. contacts (Array); 2. errorMessage (DOM element)
- Creating functions: for saving, editing and deleting contacts and also for updating the table.
- Creating events section: Events will call the functions in response to user interactions.
(Click event on the "Save" button; Click event on the "Edit" button; Click on the "Delete" button.);
