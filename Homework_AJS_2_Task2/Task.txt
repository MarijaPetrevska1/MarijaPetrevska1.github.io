The task: 

After the user clicks the button to get the first 10 planets, a button should be shown below the table that says: NEXT
10. When the button is clicked you should make another call and get the next 10 planets and change the table contents
with information about the next 10 planets. After the next 10 planets are shown the button NEXT 10 should disapear and a
new button PREVIOUS 10 should appear. The previous button should return the first 10 planets in the table and hide the
PREVIOUS 10 button and show the NEXT 10 button.

**API URL: ** https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/?page=2

The solution:

First I will start with the components the task should have: 

Initializing the variables
- variable to track the current page (currentPage), starting at 1 for the first set of planets
- creating 2 buttons: Next 10 and Previous 10

Functions Required: 
=> Function that  will fetch planet data from the API, based on the current page (currentPage).
(After the data is fetched, update the table with the new planet information).
=> Creating the function that will loop through the planets data

- Button visibility (following the steps): 
1 . After the user clicks the button to get the first 10 planets, a button should be shown below the table that says: NEXT 10. 
2. When the button is clicked you should make another call and get the next 10 planets and change the table contents with information about the next 10 planets. 
3. After the next 10 planets are shown the button NEXT 10 should disapear and a new button PREVIOUS 10 should appear. 
4. The previous button should return the first 10 planets in the table and hide the PREVIOUS 10 button and show the NEXT 10 button.

- Button clicks
    1. Initial click
    2. NEXT 10
    3. PREVIOUS 10

-Fetchcing Data:
For the first click, fetch data from https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/?page=1.
For the other page, fetch data from https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/?page=2.
