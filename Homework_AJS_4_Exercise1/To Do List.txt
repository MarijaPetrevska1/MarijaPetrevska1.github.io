===> 1. Creating the Academy class:

(calculated from subjects).
Adding methods printStudents() and printSubjects() to print students and subjects.

===> 2. Creating the Subject class:

Initializing title, numberOfClasses (default 10), isElective, academy, and students.
Adding overrideClasses() to change the number of classes, ensuring it's not less than 3.

===> 3.Creating the Student class:

Initializing firstName, lastName, age, completedSubjects, academy, and currentSubject.
Adding startAcademy() to enroll in an academy and startSubject() to enroll in a subject, 
validating conditions.

Creating an Academy, Subject objects, and link subjects to the academy.

overriding class count).
