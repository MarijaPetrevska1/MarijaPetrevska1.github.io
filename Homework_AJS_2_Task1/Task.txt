The task: 

Create an html page with a table and a button. When the button is clicked show results for the first 10 planets from the
Star Wars api. The information in the table are:
* Planet Name
* Population
* Climate
* Gravity
There should be a function that makes the call to the api for the planets ( should have URL for a parameter )
There should be a function that prints planets in to the table **API URL: ** https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/?page=1

The solution:

First I will start with the components the task should have: 

1. HTML Structure (button, table with headers: Planet Name, Population, Climate, Gravity)
2. Selecting the button and table body elements
3. Using fetch to get data from the API. =>  https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/?page=1
4. Parsing the response in JSON and handling errors.
5. Loop through the first 10 planets 
6. Attaching an EVENT listener to the button so that when clicked, the functions will be called.
7. Testing the implementation. 
(I will click the button to check if it it correctly displays the first 10 planets in the table) 

Functions Required: 
=> A function to make a call to the API.
=> A function to populate the table with the planet data.

So the main components will be: 

# Setting up HTML with a button and table.
# Fetching the data from the API.
# Displaying the data in the table with the first 10 planets' information using JavaScript.
# Adding an event listener to the button to trigger the fetch and display actions.
